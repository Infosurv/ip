1. How to properly route w/o putting the shabang?
	To get from #!/admin to an individual question view I currently do: 
		<a ng-href="#!/{{question._id}}/edit" class="edit">

	Is there a better way?


2. How to pass data from 1 public view to another?
	If I am on a questions view and want to edit this question's answer options and other attrs I would do this route:

		/questions -> /question_id/edit

	I created a view and a route in my custom_package/public/routes file.

		$stateProvider.state('admin question view', {
	      url: '/{id}/edit',
	      templateUrl: 'intengopear/views/edit.html'
	    });

	I want to basically retrieve the details for that question and then send it to the view before it's rendered. The only way I know 
	to do it now is to hit the view and then use an angular service to make the call to express and fetch the data, then update the view. 

	Can I just hit the express route first, have it fetch the data and then redirect to an angular route w the data already present? 
	I was thinking I can do that w res.render? If so is there anything special in my angular view I need to do to interpolate the data?
